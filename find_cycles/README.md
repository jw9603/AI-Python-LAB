find_cycles 함수는 텐서 형태의 edge_index을 인자로 받아서 길이 3의 순환 그래프에 속하는 노드 리스트를 만들어주는 코드이다.
노드리스트가 [a,b,c] 형태인데 이것은 노드a에서 노드b로 에지가 향하고, 노드b에서 노드c로 에지가 향하고, 노드 c에서 노드 a로 에지가 향한다는 뜻이다.


This Python code defines a function `find_cycles` that takes an `edge_index` as input and finds all the cycles of length 3 (triangles) in an undirected graph represented by the edge index.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Calculate the number of nodes in the graph by finding the maximum node index in the `edge_index`. The `max` function is used twice on the `edge_index` tensor to get the maximum value. The `+ 1` is added to account for 0-based indexing.

2. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph. The `adj_list` is a dictionary where keys are node indices, and values are lists of neighbor node indices.

3. Define a recursive function `find_cycles_dfs` that performs a depth-first search to find cycles. It takes the current `node`, the `start_node` (used for cycle detection), the `depth` (current depth in the search), `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes, `path` list to store the current path, and `cycles` set to store the found cycles.

4. Inside `find_cycles_dfs`, mark the current node as visited and add it to the `path`.

5. If the depth is 2, check if the `start_node` is a neighbor of the current node. If it is, a cycle is found. The `cycle` list is created from the `path`, ensuring that the minimum index is at the beginning to eliminate duplicate cycles.

6. If the depth is less than or equal to 2, iterate through the neighbors of the current node and recursively call `find_cycles_dfs` on unvisited neighbors.

7. After visiting all neighbors or if the depth condition is met, remove the current node from the `path` and mark it as unvisited.

8. In the main loop, iterate through all nodes in the graph. For each node, initialize the `visited` list, and call `find_cycles_dfs` with the current node as both the `node` and `start_node`.

9. Convert the set of cycles into a list of node lists and return it.

The purpose of the code is to find all unique cycles of length 3 (triangles) in an undirected graph using a depth-first search approach. Note that this code assumes an undirected graph and cycles of length 3 specifically. If you want to find cycles of different lengths or in a directed graph, the code would need adjustments.
